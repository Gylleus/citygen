# Introduction

This page will be used as documentation of method process and results for my thesis of generating virtual urban environments. I will implement a split grammar based procedural generator and attempt an approach at an inverse procedural one. I will be using Unity3D as an environment for the project.

### Split Grammar


```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Gylleus/citygen/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

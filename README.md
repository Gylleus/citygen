# Introduction

This page will be used as documentation of method process and results for my thesis of generating virtual urban environments. I will implement a split grammar based procedural generator and attempt an approach at an inverse procedural one. I will be using Unity3D as an environment for the project.

### Split Grammar

The split grammar that I will use splits and replaces shapes into other shapes, often smaller pieces. How and when such a split is performed is defined by rules. A simple example of three rules would be:



```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

Start -> split(Y) {0.7: Ground | N: Floor | 1: Top} [minY: 3]
Floor -> split(Y) {0.75: Terminal Floor | N: Floor} [minY: 1.3]
Floor -> split(Y) {N: Terminal Floor} [maxY: 1.3]

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Gylleus/citygen/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
